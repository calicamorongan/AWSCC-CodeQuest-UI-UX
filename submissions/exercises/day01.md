#### 1. UI and UX analyses for Day 1

_(just choose the questions you would like to answer and make it concise)_
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    Answer: In this category, both are user-friendly, but if I had to compare them, I suppose the one with the superior UI would win out. Because Shopee's visual was more cohesive and well-designed than Lazada's, which only included real product photographs in its categoryÂ  interface.

-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>
    Answer:There isn't really anything that needs to be mentioned, in my opinion, as everything that is posted on the websites is just there to advertise the features of the application. But perhaps maybeÂ the daily prize pop-up advertisement in the bottom left of Shopee is one of the most distracting components, though not by much.

-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platformsâ€™ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>
    Answer:To be honest, the layout and user experience of the two platforms are remarkably similar. However, it appears that Shopee is simply more orderly and neat. You can plainly see how the structure and organization of the two platforms differ, especially at the end of the websites.

<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   Is the websitesâ€™ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>
    Answer: Because they use product photographs for practically everything, Lazada's UI is a little less aesthetically pleasant than Shopee's, which is somewhat cleaner and more coherent. However, both maintain a rather constant brand and reputation.
    
-   Comment on the responsiveness of both websites across different devices.<br/>
    Answer: Nothing really jumps out as a distinction between the two platforms; they are both very comparable in my opinion.
    
-   Which do you think is better when it comes to the visual aspect of the website?<br/>
    Answer: Probably Shopee, just because the color palette that theyâ€™ve utilized in their website overall just screams out their branding more and what theyâ€™re known for.
